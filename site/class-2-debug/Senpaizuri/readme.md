# Debugging
Debugged version of the code found [here](https://github.com/cmda-fe3/course-17-18/blob/master/class-2.md#style).

[This](https://github.com/cmda-fe3/course-17-18/blob/master/class-2.md#style) code has mostly been rewritten to my own prefered way of writing code.

When declaring variables I always write the new variables on the next line with an indent
'''
var 
  foo = 'string',
'''
